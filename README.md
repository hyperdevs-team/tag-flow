# tag-flow

This script is intended to continuosly create tags according to the [semantic versioning specs](http://semver.org/) in the current head of a git repo. This script only increments the PATCH of the previously tagged version, to increment the MAJOR or MINOR number it is necessary to manually create a tag or use one of the arguments.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisities

Python 2.7+

### Installing

- Tag the first representative commit of your repo to start the "flow" (e.g. `v1.0.0`, or `0.5.2`)
- Copy tag.py in your project or add it as a submodule:
```
git submodule add git@github.com:bq/tag-flow.git
```
IMPORTANT: if you use a CI system, make sure your CI user can pull from Github, else use
```
git submodule add https://github.com/bq/tag-flow.git
```
- Inside the repo, use one of these:
```
python tag-flow/tag.py
python tag-flow/tag.py bump-minor
python tag-flow/tag.py bump-major
```

## Samples

### Increment patch
```
# python tag-flow/tag.py
Creating new tag: v1.0.45 (previous tag for branch: v1.0.44)
```

### Increment minor
```
# python tag-flow/tag.py bump-minor
Creating new tag: v1.1.0 (previous tag for branch: v1.0.44)
```

### Increment major
```
# python tag-flow/tag.py bump-major
Creating new tag: v2.0.0 (previous tag for branch: v1.0.44)
```
